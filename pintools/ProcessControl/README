startpaused.sh :
  usage: setsid ./startpaused.sh <file> -- <cmd> <args>
  starts application paused and writes PID to <file>

1) pstree-icount and pstree-timedrun are both “polling-based and global” 
 (i.e., they wake up every so many microseconds of polling and pause the 
 application once it hits a given global icount or time respectively)
2) pstree-threadperf and pstree-pccount are both 
  “interrupt-based and local” (i.e., they pause the application after 
  an interrupt occurs at the specified local thread of the application. 
  The interrupt is generated by the occurrence of the specified icount 
  or pc/count respectively)

pstree-icount:
usage: ./pstree-icount <pid> <us> <limit>
stop a process tree after a given number of total instructions on core 0
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<us>     :     polling time period in microseconds
<limit>  :     instruction count beyond which to stop (0 for run to completion)

pstree-pccount:
usage: ./pstree-pccount <pid> <tid> <pc> <limit>
stop a process tree at a given thread after <limit> occurrences of an instruction at <pc>
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<tid>    :     tid of the target thread
<pc>     :     instruction address of the target instruction
<limit>  :     no. of occurrences of <pc> after which to stop


pstree-timedrun 
usage: ./pstree-timedrun <pid> <us> <limit>
stop a process tree after executing for a given number of micro-seconds
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<us>     :     polling time period in microseconds
<limit>  :     no. of seconds after which to stop (0 for run to completion)

pstree-threadperf 
usage: ./pstree-threadperf <pid> <tid> <limit>
stop a process tree at a given thread after <limit> userspace instructions and measure performance
<pid>    :     pid of the root of a SIGSTOPPED pstree
<tid>    :     tid of the target thread
<limit>  :     no. of userspace instructions after which to stop (0 for run to completion)
